# AjaxAutoCompleteMapApp
You are required to create a registration form which will let a user select their country, county and town. This CA should use jquery &amp; jquery-ui to implement ajax calls to populate Country, Region and Sub-Region inputs and prompt the user using a mix of auto-completion and select options. The provided database has countries, counties (i.e. regions) and towns (i.e. sub-regions). The resulting page will be tested for Ireland, a county and a specific town in the selected county â€“ e.g. Ireland, Louth, Dundalk.
